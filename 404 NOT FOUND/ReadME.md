Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
  I'm a Web Designer. I have experience in this field 1 year of experience. During this challenge/project, I experienced that client requirements are major not just any simple to do. Every pixel is important in web designing or development. 
- What have you learned/improved?
  I have learnt that basics are important. Because I use generally bootstrap so I forgot how to do responsive with only css. I think basics should be revised everyday ðŸ˜œ
- Your wisdom?
  Simple project with basic knowledge and basic body pains ðŸ¤£
